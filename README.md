# 10.LinearRegression-and-LogisticRegression
Develop python program to build linear regression model and logistic regression model, check the model on a test data and predict the numerical quantities
Aim: To develop a python program to build Linear Regression model and Logistic regression 
model and predict the numerical quantities.
Requirements: Sample data set (Pima Indians diabetes dataset), Python.
Procedure:
1. In this program, we first load the dataset from the provided URL and split it into features 
(`X`) and the target variable (`y`). We then split the data into training and testing sets using an 
80-20 split.
2. Next, we build a linear regression model by creating an instance of the `Linear Regression` 
class and fit the model using the training data. We then use the model to predict numerical 
quantities on the test data (`X_test`) and store the predictions in `linear_predictions`.
3. Similarly, we build a logistic regression model by creating an instance of the 
`LogisticRegression` class and fit the model using the training data. We then use the model to 
predict numerical quantities on the test data (`X_test`) and store the predictions in 
`logistic_predictions`.
4. Finally, we print the predictions for both the linear regression and logistic regression models.
Result: Hence, a python is developed to build a Linear and Logistic Regression model and the 
numerical quantities are predicted for Pima Indians diabetes dataset.
